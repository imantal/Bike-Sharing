## Overview of the analysis
In this challenge, the data visualization software “Tableau” was used to present a business proposal for a bike-sharing company. For this purpose, the bike sharing data for NYC was imported, styled, and portrayed in Tableau. Then, multiple worksheets, dashboards, and stories created to visualize key data from a New York Citi Bike dataset.

## Results 
The first graph shows the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders. The data indicate most riders check out bikes between 3 minutes to 40 minutes.

The second graph shows the length of time that bikes are checked out for each gender. This plot is interesting as it shows even though there are fewer female riders but generally speaking the check out time patterns is similar to male riders.

The following graph shows  the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week as a heatmap. This plot is basically similar to previous plot, it only adds the breakdown based on gender. It is clear that the rush hours for female riders are less pronounced than male riders.

This heatmap shows the number of bike trips broken down by gender for each day of the week by each Usertype. It is clear that subscribers use bike sharing more than customers. The discrepancy between subscribers and customers is larger for male riders.

## Summary: 
* Generally speaking the bikes are on demand during morning and afternoon rush hours.

The following additional graph would help understand the data better:
* Trip during heat map for all riders and with breakdown based on gender
*Trip during heatmap for subscribers versus customers
